# 02-Guess-the-number

This is the second assignment for the Game Programing class. It's called Guess the Number, which asks the user to guess
a number, which will either be too low, too high, or the correct answer.
It also tells the user how many guesses/tries it took them to get to the correct answer.
There is also a bonus question that asks for the programmer's age, which will not be randomized, since it is a
specific age.
